## 🧠🎨 Doodle Dude — The AI that *Teaches with Doodles*

**Doodle Dude** is an AI-powered storytelling teacher that turns educational prompts into engaging, whiteboard-style animated video lessons. Imagine asking:

> *"Teach me about gravitation"*
> …and instantly receiving an intuitive, doodle-based video explanation crafted by AI — all without lifting a pen.

### 🔍 Vision

We’re building a **zero-input**, **multi-modal** AI educator that translates complex topics into visuals, voice, and story — designed to teach in the most *human way possible*.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### 🎥 Generation

* **Video Creation**: `moviepy`, `ffmpeg`, or `manim` (for whiteboard animation)
* **Image Generation**: `OpenAI DALL·E`, `Stable Diffusion`, or custom sketch-style models
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: `Tortoise TTS`, `Bark`, or ElevenLabs

### 🧠 AI Modeling

* **LLM**: `GPT-4`, `Claude`, or `LLaMA` (for lesson structuring and script generation)
* **Prompt Programming**: few-shot examples for instructional formatting
* **Optional Fine-tuning**: Domain-specific teacher style

### 🎙️ Audio & Voice

* Script narration generation
* Voice cloning / natural teacher voice modeling

### 🖼️ Animation Logic

* Doodle sequencing based on sentence parsing
* Scene graph generation from text
* Programmatic drawing using Bezier curves or AI-generated illustrations

### 🌐 Deployment

* `Streamlit` or `Gradio` interface for testing
* Export to MP4 or WebM for sharing
* Optional: Hugging Face Space or WebApp with `Flask`/`FastAPI`
